        Hello, I am Mahesa Bima Wijaya, a web development enthusiast. Recently, I graduated from a Fullstack Web Development bootcamp. I can do both frontend and backend programming, but I prefer
        frontend because it&apos;s more visually appealing to me. Don&apos;t get me wrong, I still have good logic, therefore, I can do backend programming too.
      </p>
      <p className="text-justify text-[15px] text-gray-600">
        You&apos;re probably wondering why it took me 2 years to get to the bootcamp after I graduated from high school. Actually, I enrolled in a college program in Informatics Engineering. A lot
        happened during that time, my finances couldn&apos;t support my college education, and the rest is history.
